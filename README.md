I'm passionate about building AI-driven enterprise solutions that enhance decision-making, streamline workflows, and uncover actionable insights. My work spans natural language processing, graph-based learning, and multimodal AI, focusing on recommendation systems, context-aware retrieval, and knowledge representation and reasoning. With a background in Computational Analytics from Georgia Tech and Finance from NYU Stern, I blend technical depth with strategic insight to build adaptable and interpretable models with real-world applications.

Beyond research and engineering, Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to advance AI while keeping a human-centered approach. Feel free to explore my work and reach out at kthakrar16@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/).
