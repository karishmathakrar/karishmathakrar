As both a developer and builder, I thrive on transforming complex AI challenges into interpretable solutions with real-world impact. My work spans generative AI, representation learning, and graph machine learning, with a focus on building models that reason, inform strategic decisions, and scale across organizations. I bring experience across the full AI development stackâ€”from data processing and model design to evaluation, deployment, and iteration in production environments.

Feel free to explore my work and reach out at kthakrar16@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karishmathakrar/).
